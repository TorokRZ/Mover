# Mover
Program to move and copy files on your PC

Done in Python & Custom tkinter

Explanation of the program's features:
- Source Directory: Choose the source directory from where you would like to copy or move files
- Destination directory: Choose the destination directory for that purpose
- File extension: With this feature you can choose specific file extensions, meaning if you wish to copy/move mp4s, or jpgs, then you have the possibility to do so.
- Move: Move the file from the source directory
- Copy: Copy the file from the source directory
- Select drive: Let's say, you want to move every single file from G:\\Downloads to a specific, organized folder, for example on the H:\\ drive. To do that, you need to select the source directory as G:\\Downloads and choose "H:" from the "Select drive" option. This will create specific folders on the destination directory, such as H:\\DocumentsH\\PDF, 'H:\\PicturesH\\JPG', 'H:\\SoundsH\\MP3', 'H:\\VideosH\\MP4'. If these folders already exist on your computer, then the program will just simply move the files accordingly.

- Execute: The execution button for the specific file extension moving/copying
- Move all: The execution button for the function that moves every single file.
